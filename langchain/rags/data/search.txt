Similarity Search
This method retrieves documents based on vector similarity.
It finds the most similar documents to the query vector based on cosine similarity
Use this when you want to retrieve the top k most similar documents.

Max Marginal Relevance (MMR)
This method balances between selecting documents that are relevant to the query and diverse
fetch_k specifies the number of documents to initially fetch based on similarity.
lambda_mult controls the diversity of the results: 1 for minimum diversity, 0 for maximum
Note: Relevance measures how closely documents match the query.
Note: Diversity ensures that the retrieved documents are not too similar to each other
providing a broader range of information.

Similarity Search Threshold
This method retrieves documents that exceed a certain similarity threshold
